# More Rails

Yesterday we created a movie app that had a movie and actor model.
Let's continue on yesterday's lesson!

- Create a new `Director` model that has the following columns:
`name` , `image`

- Create an association between director and movies so each director can have many movies and each movie belongs to a single director.

- Show the name of the director of each movie on the movie show page

- Show all movies belonging to a director on the director show page

Bonus:
- Now that we have a `director` model, remove the director column from the movie table.
