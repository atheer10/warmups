We want to build a STICKERS SHOP to sell our awesome stickers, it needs to greet the user then ask how many stickers and wait for an input. Each sticker will cost 15SAR. Our program should print out a message that includes the quantity that the user typed in, and the total cost with tax 0.05.

We also want to offer discounts for ordering a lot of stickers at once!! 

So if a user orders 50 or more stickers, they should only be charged 10SAR per STICKER. And if a user orders 100 or more stickers, they should only be charged 5SAR per STICKER.

```ruby
#Output

"You ordered 100 stickers and the total is 525.0"
```
