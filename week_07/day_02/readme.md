# Anagram Detector

Write a program that, given a word and a list of possible anagrams, selects the anagrams of the given word.

In other words, given:
```ruby
word = "listen"
arr = ["enlists", "google", "inlets", "banana", "istlen"]
```
The program should return `inlets` and `istlen`.

Extra Steps: 
- Try to do this in different ways

- Create a programs that returns the index of the word instead of the word itself

## Suggestions

- Use Ruby built-in functions to your advantage
- `split()`
- `sort`
- `join`
- `chars`
- `each_char`
