## Review of objects

For now, we'll just stick with _**one**_ way to create objects in JavaScript called _object literal notation_ or [_object initializers_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer). Feel free to use that link as a reference or find other examples online if you need a refresher.

ðŸ“š **For extra review:** read [MDN's intro to JavaScript objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics)

**1.** Pick a penguin from Wikipedia's [List of Fictional Penguins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_penguins) and create an object named `myPenguin` with properties that represent the information listed in each column on that Wikipedia page (for example: the character's name, origin, and author).

**2.** Use `console.log()` to print the penguin's name to the console as part of a welcome message, like `"Hello, I'm a penguin and my name is [NAME HERE]!"`

**3.** Write another line of code that adds a new property to your penguin called `canFly` and set it to `false`. (**Note:** Don't modify your penguin-creation code that you wrote above! Do this step in a separate line of code.)

**4.** Add a method to your penguin called `chirp` that prints to the console: `"CHIRP CHIRP! Is this what penguins sound like?"` (**Note:** Again, don't modify your previous code! Do this step by writing a new line of code.)

**5.** Add another method to your penguin called `sayHello` that prints to the console the same message from step 20 above. But this time, be sure to use the mystical, magical, all-powerful `this` keyword to access your penguin's name, so that way the `sayHello` method could potentially work for _any_ penguin that has a name!

**6.** Next, call your penguin's `sayHello()` method and make sure that it works! (**Hint:** if you need an example of what it looks like when you call a method of an object, look at `console.log()` -- that's how you call the `log()` method of the `console` object!)

**7.** Without modifying any of your previous code, change the penguin's name to `"Penguin McPenguinFace"` and then call your penguin's `sayHello()` function one more time to make sure it still works.

**8.** Write another method called `fly`, and inside that method, use an `if / else` statement to print `"I can fly!"` to the console if your penguin's `canFly` property is true, or `"No flying for me!"` if its `canFly` property is false.

**Hint:** Remember to use the very handy `this` keyword to access the object that your new method is currently attached to!

**9.** Call your penguin's `fly()` method and make sure it works!

**10.** Change the `canFly` property to `true` -- again, without modifying any of your previous code!

**11.** Now call your penguin's `fly()` method again and make sure it works as expected!

**12.** Write a _**for ... in**_ loop to print each **key** to the console. (**Hint:** See [this page](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_forin.asp) for an example of this special type of loop.)

**13.** Write another _**for ... in**_ loop to print the **value** of each key to the console. (**Hint:** You'll need to use _bracket notation_ to access the values this way, instead of _dot notation_!)


## Arrays inside objects

**14.** Add a new property to your penguin called `favoriteFoods` and set it equal to an _**array**_ containing a list of three strings.

**15.** Access your penguin's second favorite food and print it to the console using `console.log()`

**16.** Create a new variable called `firstFavFood` and set it equal to the first item in your penguin's array of favorite foods.

**17.** Add another food to the end of the list.

**18.** Print the **length** of your penguin's `favoriteFoods` array to the console with `console.log()`

**19.** Without modifying any of your previous code, write a new line of code that changes the value of the last item in the list to `"pineapples"` (overwriting the previous value).

**20.** Create a new variable named `lastFavFood` that will always point to the _**last**_ element of your penguin's `favoriteFoods` array, no matter how many items are in the list. (**Hint:** this is essentially the same problem as step 18 from above.)

**21.** Write a _**for loop**_ to iterate through every food in your penguin's `favoriteFood` property and print each one to the console. (**Hint:** This loop will look exactly the same as the one you wrote for step 16 above, except now you're accessing the array as a property of an object.)


## Objects inside other objects

It's cold at the South Pole, so let's give this penguin some clothes!

**22.** Add a new property to your penguin called `outfit` and set it equal to _**another object**_ with the following properties: `hat`, `shirt`, `pants`, and `shoes` -- each property should have a string as its value! (I suggest you give it a baseball cap, Hawaiian shirt, cargo shorts, and flip-flops, because wouldn't that be ridiculous?)

**23.** Create a new variable called `penguinHatType` and set it equal to the value of the `hat` in your penguin's `outfit`! Then print your new variable to the console.

**24.** Without modifying any of your previous code, write one new line of code to add an `accessory` property to your penguin's `outfit` and set it equal to the string `"pocket watch"` -- because penguins are classy like that!

**25.** Write one more line of code to change the `hat` in your penguin's `outfit` to `"top hat"` and override the previous value. (Again, because penguins are classy!)

**26.** This penguin is a freelancer who always works from home, so it doesn't actually need to wear any pants! Let's delete the `pants` property from this penguin's `outfit` property. (**Hint:** see [this page on the `delete` operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete) for examples.)

**27.** Write a _**for ... in**_ loop to print the **value** of each piece of clothing in your penguin's `outfit` so you can see a list of clothing items in the console. (**Hint:** This is the same as step 31 from above, only now we're accessing values from a _nested_ object!)
